Short Term:
  - Prompts

  - Ticks - STARTED
    - entities now listen for server ticks when they're created
    - #event_tick fires on each server tick
    - this is our entry point to have entities do whatever they might need to do on each tick

  - Player vs Monster combat - STARTED
      - server keeps an array of Dirtymud::Fight objects to represent each instance of a fight
      - each fight listens for server ticks to resolve itself again and again until someone dies
      - entities have an attack!(target) method that Fight calls on each tick for both fighters in the fight
      - TODO:
        - send output to the players when they attack and when they take damage
        - add a kill <target> command to initiate a fight
        - try it out!


Sometime Maybes:
  - Add player#tell <player> <txt> command to send a private msg player to player
