Short Term
  - Prompts

  - Ticks - STARTED
    - entities now listen for server ticks when they're created
    - #event_tick fires on each server tick
    - this is our entry point to have entities do whatever they might need to do on each tick

  - Player vs Monster combat!
    - THOUGHTS:
      - how to keep track of each fight in progress? 
        - keep an array of fighting entities on server?
        - each entity knows about ticks so they could keep track of their fighting state and take a swipe at their target on each tick?
      - does the order we resolve each battle loop iteration matter? i.e. initiative order for each fight. I think it probably does matter, which means having entities handle battle themselves won't resolve fights in an guaranteed consistent order because they're observing server events in a possibly unpredicible order, yes?

  


Cool Shit To Prioritize
  - Monsters
  - Add player#tell <player> <txt> command to send a private msg player to player
