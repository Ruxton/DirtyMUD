DirtyMUD was hacked together at RailsCamp Perth 2010.  It's not super awesome yet, and might not ever be.  But, I played a lot of MUDs back in high school and hacking on DirtyMUD was a fun diversion for the weekend.  Who knows, someday, it might get more development love.

Running the server: ruby run_server.rb
Connecting: telnet localhost 4000

Building the world: edit world/rooms.yml
Adding items: edit world/items.yml

Enjoy!
